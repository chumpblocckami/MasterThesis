Did a call with supervisor for the direction to take in order to do the analysis, and we agreed on follows:
1. Data ingestion for preprocessing and ingest text (in memory)
2. Apply some sort of topic modeling 
3. Apply some sort of Social Network Analysis
4. Find good resources for sentiment analysis tool (probably [http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf](VADER)). 

Essentialy what i have to come up with is a robust, flexible, real-time data ingestor for sentiment, topic modeling and social network analysis. 
Probably three distinct softwares.
