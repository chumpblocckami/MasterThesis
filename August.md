Run out of memory on MongoDB online, but for now it's enough.
I downloaded 82363 documents, with a total size of 511.54MB.
I need to consider to download only what i'll need for the analysis, so like attribute ["full-text","user","retweeted_from","lang","created_at"], so size might drop a lot.
In the meantime i used [Text-clean](https://github.com/jfilter/clean-text) for cleaning text based on language and i did a small script to load all documents text from Mongo.

Setting up the conda enviroment, updated all packages and created another cluster in MongoDB. It took all days, because my computer is commodity hardware and because there was problem with dns connecting to the mongoDB online cluster.
